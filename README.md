Project that performs community detection on a graph of scientific papers, where the nodes in the graph represent individual papers
and the edges represent the similarity between two papers.
An NLP model is used to encode the abstracts of the papers into numerical vectors, and then measure the similarity between the vectors.

The goal is to produce the graph in such a way that papers of the same science field belong to the same community.
